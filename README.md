# NewYorkCity-AirBnB-Visualization-Classification
As Airbnb moves towards becoming an end-to-end travel platform, it is increasingly important for us to deliver travel insights that help people decide when to travel, where to go, and what to do on their trips.

For example,
<p>What are the most popular landmarks and neighborhoods in New York for a reasonable price?
<p>Which Airbnb listings are best for families?
<p>What are the type of reviews about an Airbnb?
To scale our ability to answer these travel queries, we needed a systematic approach to storing and serving high-quality information about entities (e.g. ratings, cities, landmarks, events, etc.) and the relationships between them (e.g. the most popular landmark in a city for a reasonable price, the best neighbourhood to stay, etc.)
<p>
For modeling, based on the dataset, Association, Pipelining, Ensembling have been used.
